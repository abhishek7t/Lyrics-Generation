At his trial some months later he surprised everyone by mistaking a policeman for a postman and tearing his trousers off with his bare teeth.
In his defence he told the court ""It's hard to tell the difference when they take their hats off.""
Mrs Betty Pench was playing the trombone when she heard a knock on the door.
""I wonder who that is at eleven o'clock in the morning"" she thought, but cautiously opened the door and instead of the turbaned ruffian she had expected, she found a very nice young man.
""Mrs. Pench, you've won the car contest, would you like a triumph spitfire or 3000 in cash?"" He smiled.
Mrs. Pench took the money. ""What will you do with it all? Not that it's any of my business,"" he giggled.

With a geranium behind each ear and his face painted with gay cavalistic symbols, six foot eight seventeen stone police sergeant Geoff Bull looked jolly convincing as he sweated and grunted through a vigorous triscutine at the Fraga Gogo Viachella.
His hot surge trousers flapped wildly over his enormous plastic sandals as he jumped and jumped and gyrated towards a long-haired man.
""Uh, excuse me, ma'am, I have reason to believe you can turn me on.""
He leered suggestively.
As if by magic dozens of truncheons appeared and they mercilessly thrashed him.
Poor Geoff, what a turnout for the books.
Much as he hated arguments or any kind of unpleasantness, Ron Shir thought things had gone too far when, returning from a weekend in Clapton, he found that his neighbour had trimmed the enormous hedge dividing their gardens into the shape of a human leg.
Enraged and envious beyond belief, Ron seized his garden shears and clipped his white poodle Leo into a coffee table.
""That'll fix it,"" thought Ron, but he was wrong.
The following Wednesday his neighbour had his bushy waist-length hair cut and permed into a model of the Queen Elizabeth and went sailing.

The joke's on the Christmas tree, New Year's is here
The king of the living room's out on his ear
You take back the gifts that you laid at his feet
And you drag the old tannebaum out to the street
We took back the star that he thought was his crown
We packed up in papers his bright-colored gown
The lights and the ornaments back on the shelf
His majesty now can take of himself
Chorus:
And it's nay, nay, nay never
Nay nay never no more
Shall he stay green forever
He's evergreen no more
In a ditch by the roadside he dies like a dog
What once was the Christmas tree now is a log
Broken brown branches half-buried in snow
Are bones of a hero one Christmas ago
Chorus
But if you look closely, it's easy to see
A tangle of tinsel is caught in the tree
That one badge of honour is all that remains
Of those glorious Christmas tree evergreen days

It's curfew gull, it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the gates of Eden
With a time-rusted compass blade
Alladin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the golden calf
On their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the gates of Eden
Relationships of a ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned accordingly
To wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden
The motorcycle black Madonna
A two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden
At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means

Unconscious on the football field
Looks like his neck's been broken
Seems to happen somewhere every year
His mom and dad clutch themselves and cry
Their favorite son will never walk again

What spirit
What a man""

Wrapped itself around a telephone pole

I should know better than to
Give her what she wants.

She passed out before we even got to talk.
All I want to know is:
Where were you when I needed you most?
Why did you leave me alone?
We gave up before we gave it a chance,
And I don't understand.
Back to where we left off, baby.
'How you been and what's been new with you lately?'
Just forget it, it's the same old runaround.
You build me up just to let me down.

I loved you and you blew it and you broke your own heart.

To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other

And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter.
Ah you hate to see another tired man
Lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
You notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It is curling just like smoke above his shoulder.

It's you my love, you who are the stranger.

You don't know what he's after.

Upon the shore, beneath the bridge

One day, his mother said, as Pierre climbed out of bed,
""Good morning, darling boy, you are my only joy.""
Pierre said,
I don't care.
What would you like to eat?
I don't care.
Some lovely cream of wheat?
I don't care.
Don't sit backwards on your chair.
I don't care.
Or pour syrup on your hair.

I don't care.
And we have to go to town.
I don't care.
Don't you want to come my dear?
I don't care.
Would you rather stay right here?
I don't care.
So his mother left him there.
His father said, ""Get off your head
Or I will march you up to bed!""

I don't care.
I would think that you could see,
I don't care.
Your head is where your feet should be.
I don't care.
If you keep standing upside down,

We'll never, never get to town,
I don't care.
If only you would say I care,
I don't care.
I'd let you fold the folding chair,
I don't care.
So his parents left him there.
They didn't take him anywhere.
Now as the night began to fall,
A hungry lion paid a call.
He looked Pierre right in the eye,
And asked him: would you like to die?
And Pierre said,
I don't care.
I can eat you don't you see,
I don't care.
Then you would be inside of me,
I don't care.
Then you'd never have to bother,
I don't care.
With the mother and your father,
I don't care.
Is that all you have to say?
I don't care.
Then I'll eat you if I may.

Arriving home at 6 o'clock,
His parents had a dreadful shock.
They found the lion sick in bed.
They cried, ""Pierre is surely dead!""
They pulled the lion by the hair,
They hit him with the folding chair.
His mother cried, where is Pierre?
And the lion answered,
I don't care!
His father said,
""Pierre's in there?""
They rushed the lion into the town.
The doctor shook him up and down.
And when the lion gave a roar,
Pierre fell out upon the floor.
He rubbed his eyes and scratched his head
And laughed because he wasn't dead.
His mother cried and held him tight.
His father asked, ""Are you alright?""
Pierre said, ""I am feeling fine;
Please take me home it's half past nine!""
The lion said, ""If you would care,
To climb on me I'll take you there!""
Then everyone looked at Pierre,
Who shouted, ""Yes, indeed, I care!""

No school tie and no degree, no chance for me.
I found some employment, but still no enjoyment, I worked in a factory.
I picked up my wages, fhe first time in ages, it don't seem enough to me.

You came along, the time was right - turned on the light.

Our mouths filled with dust. we kissed in the fields and under trees, screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves. It was empty on the edge of the town, but we knew everyone floated along the bottom of the river. So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea and the shattered seasons lay, and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease. In our cancer of passion, you said, ""Death is a midnight runner.""
The sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide. We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes of stars that wore like an antique wedding dress. The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn, as the Ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop. A few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime. I kissed you at the apex of the maelstrom and asked if you would accompany me in a quick fall; but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't good for two. I rode alone.
You said, ""The cinders are falling like snow."" There is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty, bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence, of blue and grey. Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city. The sun has stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon, and darkness is a mystery of curves and lines. Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward; and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation scratched into the earth like a message.",en

For the duration..
Overzealous inhabitants flock with abundance
Paying tribute, to the one the circumfrence
Of the stadium, is paying homage, to my cranium
The sea of heads doesn't seem to hide the lady
In the back row, waving her hands for the ohh
The usual crowd rock line for a show
And I dispense with the usu-al, and keep it coastin
To boom up the set my advice is take a motion
Before you walk through the door, of a chubb rock tour
Buy the anthology in any store
Frontin, now we'll have ya, tougher than mutton
If I touch your button you'll start kick like charles dutton
Lyrics persevere and you really must strive
Three years gone but I will survive
I.. i.. I will will, survive, now ho!

They say that scent is the strongest sense
It's tied to memories
The stench of this place is almost as bad
As the memory tied to it
Tried to forget that sickening stench
With everything I've got
You can't trust a heart that was cold from the start
You waste your time on it
The healing power of alcohol
Only works on scrapes and nicks
And not on girls in seedy bars
Who drown themselves in it
You could play all day
And tell your friends that everything's alright
The truth is that your heart collapsed
Two years ago tonight
Should thank your lucky stars
For all the times you've been ashamed
You'll learn more from the harder times
Than times that you've been vain
The lesson you learned is priceless
If you can take a spin
You threw away your friends
As if drinks were all the friends you need
The healing power of alcohol
Only works on scrapes and nicks
And not on girls in seedy bars
Who drown themselves in it
You could play all day
And tell your friends that everything's alright
The truth is that your heart collapsed
Two years ago tonight
The truth is that your heart collapsed

And all the many times I've cried.

Pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears

And they just didn't count on
The tears.
They lived for a while in a
Very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter
Of course
And they parted the closest
Of friends
Then the king and the queen went
Back to the green
But you can never go back
There again

Already by the summer of '75
From the high to the low to
The end of the show
For the rest of their lives

Pick up the pieces

Find a way to get by

Have been trained in the art of pleasing men.
Be lonely no more, open destiny's door.
For one dollar they arrange a meeting.
My image was wrong, I didn't like me,
So I changed my personality.
I bought a delux Merseybeat wig
But it was a size too big.
What confidence in my new built-up shoes,
So smart for winter or summer.
Undetectable in normal everyday use.
Look out there's a monster coming!
Bye-bye binoculars and macintosh,
Everything is just great.
I take elocution, learn to speak posh
But still I can't find a mate.
Be popular, learn to play the guitar,
In seven days you could be strumming.
Be sociable, learn kissing technique.
Look out there's a monster coming!
Carnaby clothes, I reshaped my nose,
Plastic surgery's best.
To cut down my weight off comes my left leg.
I pass a swimming costume test.

Don't my aftershave pong?
I know my new nose ain't runnin'.
What's wrong with my tie?
Am I getting too high?

I had removed electrically.
I rejuvenated my energy cells
And regained my virility (grunt grunt).

Or the people who finally can't take anymore
And they pick up a gun or a brick or a stone

- (by Bob Franke)
Death took the husband of a neighbor of mine
On a highway with a drunk at the wheel
She told me keep your clean hands off the laundry he left
And don't tell me you know how I feel
She had a tape that he'd sent her from a Holiday Inn
That she never played much in the day
But when I heard him say I love you through the window at night
I just stayed the hell away
Chorus:
There's a hole in the middle in the middle of the prettiest life
So the lawyers and the prophets say
Not your father nor your mother nor your lover's ever gonna make it go away
Now there's too much darkness in an endless night
To be afraid of the way we feel
Let's be kind to each other
Not forever but for real
My father never put his parachute on
In the pacific back in World War II
He said he'd rather go down in familiar flame
Than get lost in that endless blue
Well some of that blue got into my eyes
And we never stopped fighting that war
Until I first understood about endlessness
And I loved him like never before
There's a hole in the middle in the middle of the prettiest life
So the lawyers and the prophets say
Not your father nor your mother nor your lover's ever gonna make it go away
Now there's too much darkness in an endless night
To be ashamed of the way we feel
Let's be kind to each other
Not forever but for real
Lucky my daughter got her mother's nose
And just a little of her father's eyes
And we've got just enough love
That when the longing takes me
It takes me by surprise
And I remember that longing from my highway days
When I never could give it a name
And it's lucky that I discovered in the nick of time
That the woman and the child aren't to blame
For the hole in the middle of a pretty good life
I only face it 'cause it's here to stay
Not my father nor my mother nor my daughter nor my lover
Nor the highway made it go away
But now there's too much darkness in an endless night
to be afraid of the way I feel
I'll be kind to my loved ones
Not forever but for real
Some say god is a lover, some say it's an endless void
And some say both, and some say she's angry
And some say just annoyed
But if god felt a hammer in the palm of his hand
Then god knows the way we feel
And then love lasts forever
Forever and for real

Must lead to another breath out, one more breath yesterday
From yesterday -- and a timeline of yesterdays

Averting your eyes from those staring questions, how were those bruises made?

Beautiful words about beautiful feelings
What lots of believin' could do

Each year for thirteen years
Each year, it gets harder to hear
It's getting harder now just to stay in love
And now our roots grow deep
Beneath these barren streets
I have the darkest dreams
The city's pipes and wires
Went through our nerves and veins
And those nights, after a double shift, I feel it
The test plans you never dared to live
They used to light up your eyes
Those bulbs have long burned out
Let a tornado tear through
Let it tear straight through our roof
And let the rain pour in
I'll scream, ""Babe, this is it!""
We'll leave the house in ruins
If we escape right now, we just might make it out
This city, this city's killing us
This city, this city's killing us
This city, this city's killing us
It's killing us
It's killing us
This city, this city's killing us
This city, this city's killing us

He's strong and tall and lean
His body like a greyhound
And his mind so sharp and keen
But his heart just like a laurel
Grew twisted on itself
'Til almost everything he did
Brought pain to someone else
Chorus:
'Cause it's not just what you're born with
It's what you choose to bear
It's not how much your share is
But it's how much you can share
And it's not the fights you've dreamed of
But those you really fought
It's not just what you're given
It's what you do with what you've got
Now between those who use their neighbor
And those who use a cane
Between those in constant power
And those in constant pain
Between those who run to evil
And those who cannot run
Tell me which ones are the cripples
And which ones touch the sun
Chorus
For what's the use of two strong legs
If you only run away
And what good is the finest voice
With nothing good to say
And what good is strength and muscle
If you only push and shove
What's the use in two good ears
If you can't hear those you love

Lost all their rights

Got the chance to reach freedom
But no one knew that there's no escape
There was only one approach
Of sand and rubble

Got a projection of 5 minutes

Anytime at all
It's never simple dear
To be in summer cheer
Underneath your Gortex and furs
If your colors fade in the wash
Of the sleet and snow in Osh Kosh
Just keep it cool in all temperatures

In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold
Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave

We held hands on the last night on earth.
Our mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields and under trees,
screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves.
It was empty on the edge of town but we knew everyone floated
along the bottom of the river.
So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea
and the shattered seasons lay,
and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease.
In our cancer of passion you said, ""Death is a midnight runner.""
The sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide.
We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes
of stars that wore like an antique wedding dress.
The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn
as the ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop.
The few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime.
I kissed you at the apex of the maelstrom and asked
if you would accompany me in a quick fall,
but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't good for two.
I rode alone.
You said, ""The cinders are falling like snow.""
There is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty,
bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence.
Of blue and grey.
Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city.
The sun was stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon
and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines.
Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward,
and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation scratched
into the earth like a message.

After murder, we encounter
the great mystery
That which surpasses the human
experience, the human disease
Directly before, a moment or
two after and essentially
during murder - great mysteries
revealed
Animal introduction, the first
prehistoric urge instilled at
birth
the first cries of freedom
If only from the womb
And birth and death do not end it
This transgression is perhaps
the first
And final step in the evolutionary stage
Before and after reincarnation
Seen through the muderer's eyes...
The only true free spirit
Dark horse rider
Maggot's lair - blindess
The first incision fulfills the need for the last
Seen through animal eyes
And God's eye
Through the murderer's eye
The first incision fulfills the
need...
And God's eye
The lord is my shepherd;
I shall always want
He maketh me to lie in
wait for rapture
He leadeth me to vile
waters, He destroyeth
my soul, He leadeth me
in the path of blindness
for his name's sake
In the valley of the
shadow of death
Thou appeareth before me
In robes of silicon and
rust
Thou doth defile me as
no other has before thee
I fear all life-for thou art with me
Thy rod and staff serve
to defeat me
In the presence of mine
enemies

Where nothing matters, but can touch

Instilled with fear and bleachy guilt
Impatient winds up in her cloth

With weighty promises of love

From green grass or sinking mud
Stagnating, knowing the delusion
Clean sheets waiting for a body
Slapped into life and slowly gutted

2114,master-song,2006,cohen-leonard,Rock,"I believe that you heard your master sing
When I was sick in bed.
I suppose that he told you everything
That I keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you traveling,
Well at least that's what you said.
And now do you come back to bring
Your prisoner wine and bread?
You met him at some temple, where
They take your clothes at the door.
He was just a numberless man in a chair
Who'd just come back from the war.
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
And he hands you the apple core.
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
Of all the kisses we put on some time before.
And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk
With a collar of leather and nails,
And he never once made you explain or talk
About all of the little details,
Such as who had a word and who had a rock,
And who had you through the mails.
Now your love is a secret all over the block,
And it never stops not even when your master fails.
And he took you up in his aeroplane,
Which he flew without any hands,
And you cruised above the ribbons of rain
That drove the crowd from the stands.
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane
And, an ape with angel glands,
Erased the final wisps of pain
With the music of rubber bands.
And now I hear your master sing,
You kneel for him to come.
His body is a golden string
That your body is hanging from.
His body is a golden string,
My body has grown numb.
Oh now you hear your master sing,
Your shirt is all undone.
And will you kneel beside this bed
That we polished so long ago,
Before your master chose instead
To make my bed of snow?
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
And you're speaking far too low.
No I can't make out what your master said
Before he made you go.
Then I think you're playing far too rough
For a lady who's been to the moon;
I've lain by this window long enough
To get used to an empty room.
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
Who is tapping his foot to a tune,
And your thighs are a ruin, you want too much,
Let's say you came back some time too soon.
I loved your master perfectly
I taught him all that he knew.
He was starving in some deep mystery
Like a man who is sure what is true.
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new,
And I taught him how you would long for me
No matter what he said no matter what you'd do.
I believe that you heard your master sing
While I was sick in bed,
I'm sure that he told you everything

Hebrews 12 says
Therefore, since we are surrounded
by such a great cloud of witnesses,
let us throw off everything that hinders
and the sin that so easily entangles,
and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
Let us fix our eyes on Jesus,
the author and perfecter of our faith,
who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men,
so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.""
Jesus, we give You our praise,
You're our greatest prize, our greatest treasure
and we will forsake everything to the joy of knowing You.
We worship You alone in this place.

Johnny's got the hunger of a high school heart
And a tank full of minimum-wage
So its six lights down, six lights back
Pacing like a lion in a cage
He's running on a tether
Tearing at the ground
Trying to find a way to break the chain
This howling in the distance
Its a captivating sound
Can't tell if its ecstasy or pain
Saturday they'll all be back again
All those engines pulling all night long
Still makes a slow moving train
They can scream out their freedom
When the light turns green
But they're bound to come 'round again
Standing at a distance there's the dark haired girl
Johnny doesn't know her name
He howls his engine like a big, black dog
Choking on his collar by his chain
Its lonely, like hunger
Driven to the same old place
Rumble like thunder

And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great
The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen, Myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once as her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world, sailors navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss with her sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot
The day has come for all us sinners
If your not a servant you'll be struck to the ground.
Flee the burning, greedy city looking back on her to see there's nothin' around.
I don't believe in fairy tales
And no one wants to go to Hell
But you made the wrong decision
And it's easy to see.

Because you've got nowhere to go

Let The New Born Take His Own Place
[Storyteller]
After a while he began to dream and a wide open space appeared before his eyes. Standing just in front of him was a great golden gate suspended in the air. The entrance to the gate was surrounded by a majestic sound of choirs and bells. All of a sudden, the gate was opened and Genius was captured by an incredible vortex that led him to the huge entrance. At the end of that stormy moment, Genius saw through the haze two strange masses slowly taking shape before his eyes. The figures seemed to be two beautiful women with sweet smiles upon their faces. With a delicate whisper, the women welcomed him",en

Its only so much left of the day

Would you be so kind
Let the sun light play with your mind
And if you ever want to walk out
Would you be set free
Cause theres so many places to see
And I could be the wild child
And you could be the sky
We go by gathering time, yes
Ill stay with you if you keep on laughing
But its all we can do for the world in passing
When its all that we have, all that we need to find
I really should be gone now before it gets too late
All chances that I didnt take
I stand before the mirror and I count to 3
And then Ill become nothing like me, no

Ill stay with you if you keep on laughing

And it shines in the darkness

Making it bear fruit and sprout
So Your word will be
For the word is living and active
Like a sword piercing the division
Of soul, marrow and spirit
And even as the rain and snow come down
And do not return empty

Bigger than the town they were driving from.
Business took place during office hours in both towns.
This drive was considered business
The feeling of passing other cars was also considered business
A feeling of business being done.
The feeling of drifting slowly through a field of moving vehicles.
This was the REAL speed - the speed of business.
Not the numbers on the speedometer.
One of them was playing with the radio
Slowly changing the channel from one station to another
Sometimes listening to both channels at once.
On one channel a man was talking to another man on the telephone.

All I wanna do is,
Run from this spot like I don't really need this,
Everybody all up in my face for no reason,
I'm pacing, I'm wheezing,
Jot my thoughts down,
Push the pen better than them, so who the boss now,
Run from this spot like I don't really need them,
Everybody fake it's getting hard to believe them,
A slave to my demons, a beast when I breathe in,
Turn the music up, I need something to believe in
[VERSE 1: CRAW]
I been held to another standard, that's above par,
Pardon me, you probably didn't see I rip it until it's hard to breathe,
I be in the back with an IV, squeezing oxygen out of every artery,
Hard to be part of me partially orbiting stars in me,
Morbidly morning the mourning I'm morning harmony,
Pouring enduring your story is hard for me to look at,
Why? Because I wrote the fucking book Jack,
I don't wanna look back like everything I should have,
Could have been accomplished, that's why I gotta rock this,
Get in my way and I may take a hostage,
Price you pay for fucking with a monster,
Ya'll don't really want that, I don't want it either, hah,
And you 'aint got to thank Jehovah or Jesus, nah,
Only one god you gotta believe in,
His name is Crawdad, so say it like you mean it

Rewind to find they below par, that's rap spelled backwards, huh,
I'm a savage with some habits that I can't shake,
Ravaged little rabbit that'll stab you with a handshake,
Wait, I really need to shake it off tho,
Get up out this shit hole and find a decent spot yo,
But I can't it's like my mind got the best of me,
Step into the future, hindsight's destiny,
Effortlessly evident to see that I'm a veteran,
To be the better man but never feeling better than,
Let it in medicine man, tethered together if ever I am,
Feather to feather I'm flying better than I planned, but,

It's such a funny feeling
Got no idea, what time it is
Delightfully confusing
The trees outside, the morning light
Arrives, like pirates on parade
Surprise, it's pirates on parade
A ray of light, between the blinds
I lie there in a stupor
I hear a thud, and then a flush
Guess it must be the neighbors
I blink my eyes, I laugh inside
Imagine what they're saying
I see your shape and through the night
Here come, those pirates on parade
Ahoy, it's pirates on parade
Through the rough and stormy weather
On a search for buried treasure
There's an island to explore
Every wave that whispers softly
""Stay in bed, 'cause it's still early""
Dolphins frolic by the shore
And the phone never rings when the pirates are singing
Well there's 16 men on a dead man's chest
In this hallucination
The map we got, x marks the spot
We're following directions
The 7 seas, the balmy breeze
The pleasure of surrender
The end is nigh, the sun is high
It's late, for pirates on parade
Too late, for pirates on parade
Traffic noises down below me
A helicopter circles slowly
Monsters sink into the deep
Mountainous and downy billows
Float among those fluffy pillows
Maybe I'll go back to sleep
And the phone never rings when the pirates are singing
This wicked life
So what's in store behind that velvet curtain?
The night is gone
And the day is here
The stupid sun is shinin'
The moon reflects

It's lovely imperfections

The clear blue skies

To childhood spread with fond maternal care
From the day that he was born
Proud relations came to fawn
And compliment his pretty golden hair
In boyhood sent away
To a boarding school to stay
Its crumbling proud traditions forced to bear
And his friends in this new world
Said he looks more like a girl
With those blue eyes and pretty golden hair
Fades secluded youth
Into manhood's search for truth
His mother's eyes now wet had turned to stare
For he said I must be bound
This day for London town
For I believe my fortune's waiting there
So like an eager cutting knife
He plunged in a new life
Oh never known beforehand anywhere
And the thought that he might trip
In his ignorance and slip
Never struck beneath his pretty golden hair
Ah the days soon grew thin
And boredom fast set in
His job was thrown away without a care
For a man who softly said
You'll earn twice as much instead
With those blue eyes and pretty golden hair
Well London town possessed
Of many a tempter's nest
And thus he fell with scarce another care
As so easily he slipped
Into prostitution's grip
Foundationed by his pretty golden hair
Ah but the years quickly flew
And his mind slowly grew
From early freedom into deep despair
As the money ceased to roll
A tired and lonely soul
Poured curses on his pretty golden hair
Ah the years stole their time
Now the living's hard to find
And early friends have vanished in the air
And the gay parties's ease
Changed to public lavatories
Have turned to grey his pretty golden hair
Oh his life was only used
And his body just abused
By those who never think and never care
But though his file said suicide
No, that wasn't why he died
It was murder by his pretty golden hair",en

There were people already trying to get me gone
Telling me to quit rapping
Just play the keys that
""My band had a singer"", ""They didn't need me""
But my band had my back, so we did the tracks
Put out the album and the talk went flat
It was funny at first, but then the humor faded
When some magazines printed that our label made us
We were too good to be true
Some were saying ghostwriters were writing all that we do
So we had to disprove it, we spelled it out
To the detail, how we do it when we're making this music
After that I made it a rule:
I only do email responses to print interviews
Because there people love to put a twist to your words
To infer that you said something ducking fucking absurd
Oh, did I lose you at 'infer'?
Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first-grade vocabulary words?

Since my love did leave this life
My joys have been but few

Like summer's windy breath
No sooner had she warmed my heart
Than had she left my bed
Had she left my bed
CHORUS:
Won't you sing to me the perfect song
That I might smile again
Won't you sing to me the perfect song
That I might smile... smile again
The melody enchanted me
With words I can't describe
It danced around the room until
It vanished in the night
The lyrics spoke of beauty
Only gods and angels know
She touched me on the cheek
With gentle hands like flakes of snow
Some day soon we'll meet again
If it's in a dream I'll never wake
So it won't end
We'll live in my head

It breaks pieces above the forest
A million particles born today
Out beyond the blue horizon
Air cannot escape
Underneath the weeping willow
I can see your face
Free form - climbing all over me
Creatures great and small
Doctors - pulling them out of you
Hideous, virtuous, both of us
Come - in my kitchen
When it rains outside

Sneaks up from behind

That the bigger the front
The bigger the back

To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I just live my life in dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago, still make me blue
And they say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say

It's no surprise this is where you back down
I've heard the stories,
This is where you come up short
It's not really a big deal, it's not really a big deal
You just threw it all away.
You've got your shades shut tight,
But you left the door wide open.
And you know it's everything you wanted
But you set yourself apart
No fingers need be pointed
You put yourself where you are
Did it fold? Did it fold?
For every action there's a consequence,
So just keep distant,
Cause it's time you sent this one out.
It is really a big deal, yes it is, a really big deal.
You just threw it all away.
You've got your shades shut tight,
But you left the door wide open.
And you know it's everything you wanted
But you set yourself apart
No fingers need be pointed
You put yourself where you are
Did it fold? Did it fold?
Did you get your lies straight?
Cause you've been hit with reality.
Where you could call the fate
The trust doesn't come with a guarantee.
Who you gonna call when there's no one left around?
Who you gonna call when there's no one left around?
It's everything you wanted,
But you set yourself apart.
No fingers need be pointed
You put yourself where you are
Did it fold? Did it fold?
Did it fold? Did it fold?
Just watch it unfold.
Did it fold? Did it fold?
Just watch it unfold
It's everything you wanted.

2075,big-darkness,2003,crooked-fingers,Rock,"Dead in the sun and covered in glue
There is a town where nothing moves
Nobody works and nobody plays
And all of their dreams have melted away
All of their hopes have come and gone
Even the vultures have moved on
They say a hero's coming soon
With ivory lungs like huge balloons
There ain't no moon and there ain't no stars
Over the land of endless scars
Covered in brown and coming undone
We are what we will not become
Only a rundown rusty still
Runs through a town that has no will
But they say a hero's coming soon
He's coming to take a giant breath
Into his lungs and blow away the sun
I saw a vulture swarming up above a dying crowd
Above the villains and the heroes and the down-and-out
To snag the carrion and leeches and to stake their claim
Before the darkness has a chance to wash it all away
And if the evening ever comes maybe it'll set things right
'Cause in the dark even the blind can feel a speck of light
I'm looking for a sign to show but it don't ever come
I'm waiting for the dark to fall and wash away the sun
There ain't no heat and there ain't no light
Only the black hole of our eyes
Caught in an overcrowded room
Waiting for its set and two moves
But out in the distance there's a glow
That nobody sees so nobody knows
Well they say a hero's coming soon
He's coming to take a giant breath of air
Into his lungs and blow away the sun",en

All night long I have been waiting
We who are constantly moving
Leaving part of us behind

Mona lisa smiles up on her face
I who am completely mesmerized
By the sunlight in her eyes
Morning sun comes through my windows
All night long I have been waiting
We who are constantly moving
Leaving part of us behind
Moves across the room with easy grace
