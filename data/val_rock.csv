2594,country-bumpkin,2007,conway-twitty,Rock,"(Don Wayne)
He walked into the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall bar stool
With a long soft southern drawl said I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool
A barroom girl with wise and knowing eyes slowly looked me up and down
And she said I wonder how on earth that country bumpkin found his way to town
And she said hello country bumpkin how's the frost out on the pumpkin
I've seen some sights but man you're somethin'
Where'd you come from country bumpkin
Just a short year later in a bed of joy filled tears and death like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders another wonder came
That same woman's face was wrapped up in a raptured look of love and tenderness
As I marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy child feeding at her breast
And she said hello country bumpkin fresh as frost out on the pumpkins
I've seen some sights but babe you're somethin' mommy loves her country bumpkin
Forty years of hard work later in a simple quiet and peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased the raptured wonder from my woman's face
She was lying on her death bed knowing fully well her race was nearly run
Byt she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son
And I said so long country bumpkins the frost is gone now from the pumpkins
I've seem some sights and life's been somethin' see you later country bumpkins
See you later country bumpkins",en

Grab binoculars and watch you fall
Follow the leader, harder to read ya
Part of the reason I'm falling to pieces
Stuck with a little bit of you in my membrane
Do what the pen say, move till you press play
Do Rae me fa so la ti dope
Don't let me give nobody hope
Nope, 'ain't nothing left to finish
Rewind the clock, line of scrimmage
Sign of friendship, blind to when it started
Nearly departed, dearly beloved
We gather today to part with the part of Mike that perished
When his heart of ice fell there and melted under the light you bear, it's
Nothing new, stuck in the same old shit
Where the pain gon' slip and it 'ain't gon' get out this house
Till you get to the place where the brain don't trip and the fangs dope grip and the veins don't grip
And it 'ain't no shit to me, fictions still a fairy tale
The air I breathe is fairy stale
Forgive me if I'm ill as fuck, when it comes to rap - killin stuff

There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured, as it was, by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence that was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them
They only saw shadows you see, without the truth to the eyes
The happy folk were blind
Falling out of airplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead
In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
It's rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the strange folk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain
Holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the monkey would stir from it's deep sleep
Then there came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany so immense
That it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called monkey had spoken

The gold bars and the gun

And once again you've bought a little time
And once again you're fading out of sight

What it is that keeps you just that step ahead
No one can say
In one last raid the agents
Of the dawn break down the door
Of a house where you were standing
Maybe just an hour before
And still the thread continues to unwind
You take the hidden roads that only you can find
And should they come upon your tracks
There's just a question hanging back you left behind

Still I yearn and though I didn't know just what it was,

A lifetime of dreaming, visualizing paradise
I woke up, rolled over and told my girl we're leaving
It's time to sacrifice a lot
'Cause you ain't happy with your job
And round here it's like nothin' seems appealing
So let me know you feel the same
Throw your life into a case and we'll depart from Victoria this evening
And then embark upon a path of rediscovery
Searching for the fruits from the lost garden of Eden
I'm wondering if I runaway and came back another day,
Then would the young men who roll with metal put the guns away
And would the devil have took charge or would the slum be safe
I pray the latter's right for everybody's mumsy's sake.
And if I disappear for years and reappear
Would my natural intuition still be crystal clear?
Or would I have lost clarity?
In this trivial pursuit we're walking through so casually
I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.
We share a last cigarette, then walk into the station
Purchase two tickets to an alien destination
Board the train and witness pain on all the faces of multi-cultural races
But not me and my girl we're breaking free
Like an escapist, 'cause we need to escape this
And I for one have got my mind made up,
Even if where we stay is make-shift
I can't remain in this domain of semi ape shit, because all I see is hatred
I wonder if I disappeared how many men would miss me
Or would they all forget like I erased my name from history?
I'm still trying yet to make a break within the chain of pain and misery
And vanish off the planet like a mystery.
And if I did return and things were the same or worse?
You'd see the gear stick shift and
Then the I would reverse and I'd be straight back on my travels
Burning rubber over gravel 'til we see the English Channel
I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.
As the carriage pulls away,
I pull my lady closer and I tell her she's okay
'Cause if we never broke the barricades today we'd always be afraid
And left to feel threatened in this dark and deadly maze
But now I've come of age,
And as the train starts enterin' suburbia a smile comes across my face
The unwinding of eternal rage,
That was locked up inside just like my mates behind prison gates
If I could runaway and come back another day,
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day.
Kick back and just enjoy the raves,
With a lager and a spliff to blaze.
If I ever contemplate returning to this crazy place
I'd leave it long enough so they don't recognize my face
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day
While I roll upon the roads along the motorway
I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be

Economics shape the battle landscape
All join together for the grand rape
Moral intentions make a scapegoat
Excuse the rotting corpse inside the trenchcoat
Praise the rotting minds above the club tie

Above the clouds, obscure the scarred earth
Discuss manoeuvres, moves for more death
Arms make profit from the crushed head
Build the towers up on the ditch dead
Betrayal forms the formal skyline
Tinted windows catch the sunshine
Such ice cold beauty makes the heart sink
Five thousand miles away the dead stink
And here the graveyard to insult them
The city shines with laughing tombstones
The profiteers, the warcry butchers
Stir up the lust for legal slaughter
The living dead who look up to them
Who accept authority the kills them
Work for the corporation making napalm
Workers watch the burning children
On T.V. as they eat their meat pie
With refusal in their minds eye
To see their own lives in that cold death
Their state of wealth upon that lost breath
In the official offices of deathplan
Leaders of men work to betray man
Stocks and shares declare the next war
The torture starts behind the locked door
Propaganda tops the big desk
Compose an overture to fine death
The hideous grey men of our nightmares
Dim the colour, foul the clean air
Their eyes forsake all that they dwell on
Drag the lover from the loved ones
Patriots progress is a backstep
A cruel noose around a young neck

To respect a madman on a rostrum
To praise the the dirty works of battle
Bring out the ribbon, balloon and rattle
To dig their own graves in the cold earth

Of you and me
Left me on my knees

I'm still begging please
And I really just wanna why
babe if you're home please pick up the phone

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up

And I know you're only doing this to
Hurt me, girl, and I'm dying inside

To get goodbye,
If were meant to be just thought I should be happy
And I'm saying it straight from the phone
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
Guess it is what it is I..

I just can't stop loving you (cant stop, can't can't stop)

5214,1989,2010,devlins,Rock,"I remember when I was twelve years old
No worries in my brain with a pound in my pocket
And a chest full of smoke
I remember all the chordies we drove.
We used to play football all day and use jumpers for goalposts
And throw egg yolks at windows to wind up the old folks
Started learning about the birds and the bees
So there's birds from my class on their knees behind trees.
My favorite emcee was Sharkey Major
Way before I hit one double O three, Temptation, Kiss 100, or Flava
Get off from school and take
Ninety two point three but let's skip forward in time
Seven years down the line and it seems the spotlights on me
Sometimes I still wish that I was still twelve or thirteen.

Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'

Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
Fifteen, bag of weed, bag of beers in the park
Duckin' out from Feds in the dark.
Then we appear with grass stains up and down my legs and arms
And with a fresh beer clenched in my palm.
Sixteen, my bars are different class
I've been rolling with Dogz and Glamour and Shotz for a year
I've been steppin' up fast.
I guess I got around in the bits.
I was selling bags of bud and Tales from the Crypt.
I met Ghetts when I was fourteen, lost touch.
By sixteen, I'd linked up with Ghetts again
Rolling with The Movement and started doing sets for them.
Mercston, Scorcher, Unique and Wretch and 'em.
Two thousand six, I was seventeen when I finished my first solo CD
But this time there's an album in the midst.

Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
By the time I hit seventeen, I was the coldest younger on the scene
With bars you never heard and flow you never seen.
Before I come around it was 'cock it and shoot'.
Emcees being cocky and rude, then I moved to some deep concepts in my tunes.
Monitor my brain waves, tell me if I'm crazed but I think the games changed
And emcees are opening doors in the same ways.
As I did when I was a kid, on Rinse radio waves
And now I'm paving the way for a fatal display
Might blaze in a haze till I'm dazed then wave a grenade in your face
Seventeen with bars that I regulate and generate pace
I'm only scared of who my enemies face.

Now it's time to prove what Devlin can do.
From the very first time I ever crept on a tune
I've immensely improved, the ascendance is due.
Original spitter, not remnants of you.
Swear I can see success in my view.
Crazy what letters in a sentence can do
'Cause my lyrics are the only thing sending me through.
Kanye called me a gangster rapper; I'm not a gangster rapper
Devs, I just spit it real.
You're an emcee like C difficile.
I look skinny 'cause I keep on missing meals.
I'll get cold like you know how frigid feels.
No children, sticking them rigid still

I dug down deep into the dirt
searching for my treasure

I found the same note in every measure

listen to the song in your soul

No one can show you the way
You gotta live out your days
and when you are ready
you will know
I left my body and roamed the heavens
to learn something new in this place
and flying high above the earth and sky
I learned there is more to space than just space
I took to the ocean for twenty years and two days
to change my outlook on the world

A swollen face,
A bloody tongue,
This violence denied.
Empty now and meaningless,
Ridiculed in shame,
Until death do us apart,
Who should take the blame?
To live a lie
Forgive or die.
A stricken look,
A lowered head,
Reflections, turning back.
A trembling hand,
A quickened step,
The dreaded, next attack.
Turning from the holy ghost,
Light and spirit fade.
Waiting for deliverance,
Every thing betrayed.
To live a lie
Forgive or die.
A vacant stare,
A beat-up faith,
The book of truth reviled.
A prayer to God,
A plea for help,
Held ransom with the child.
Wide awake and holding tears,
Fear that never sleeps,
Curled up in the bed at night,
The virgin gently weeps.
To live a lie
Forgive or die",en

Maurice took a notion to rip off the house down the street.
Heard they had a whole lot of real good weed.
He snuck around back and made it in the house okay, and he
located the stash and he rolled up a jay.
He got high and hungry, wanted somethin' to eat.
Went in the kitchen and ate up every damn thing he could see.
But, man, between the food and the weed,
he lay down on the couch and he went to sleep.
He got caught in the middle of the night.
Oh, ain't it a shame? The dude can't even do wrong right.
Got him a new car, went out to celebrate.
Got hung up at the bar and started runnin' late.

Said, ""Hundred miles an hour! Woo! Look at me go!""

Found him a woman, way across town.

You might say its self-destructive

Hymns of hate in memorandum

Test and MC's start fessin
Jettin cause my weapon among the children was my gung-ho attitude
to use my tongue and lash and lick them up
then pick them up then just fix them up then mix them up with
a knowledgeable man that went to college and astonished
racist teachers with all the modern preachers
Crack beepers, yes knowledgeable preachers

Get my music and bop to it
Gassed my head but I was goin for my doctorate
or my Ph.D in P-A-I-D, see
I got into the business to get paid not sprayed
with BS which is an acronym for a much larger word
and if preferred, I'll say it

Where your fingers go numb.

And shadows where you hope lies.

You hope that no one will betray you
But they do.
The voices in your head control you
And your body slows you down.
You want to live but there is no reason to
You have no clue where to draw the line from pleasure or pain.
Only thing you do is just blame your problem on some one else.
Your mind is so disturbed
You think that being famous is a reason to be ignorant.

It takes all the strength I have in me

The night of the soul

Painful to see years of neglect
Achin' to see all that they see
Still telling lies to the remains of respect

Given to you without ending
Given to you, the purpose of art
Thousands of plans, I've made many
I wonder just how many plans I have made

A local roadside shack
A poor man's Paris with a parking lot in the back
There's a girl there
She knows how to unwind
She don't talk much but she knows just how to act

The money's just a mere formality
Every day, every night
Somethings going on, something's going on
Down the road over yonder
Any place, any time when I'm fading
My love lies waiting
Down the road tonight
When I was younger
All the older boys
Would drive me way out past the county fair
They'd laugh and point out
This roadside trailer
And say something wild's going on over there
They said, what they're doing
Don't mean nothing to you now
But someday it'll mean everything

They were dealing one-eyed jacks

Pain
Somewhere between the lies and truths, borderlines get shady.
Somewhere between the yeses and nos you can find a maybe.
Somewhere between the highs and lows you can spot the middle.
Somewhere between the questions and clues you can solve the riddle
Somewhere along the road you might need a place to stay.
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to pass away.
And somewhere in space you still remind me of a reason.
And summertime you still smell like my favorite season.
Chorus:
And it feels like pain
It's just like pain
Love is like pain
Some people like pain
Somewhere between the mountain and sea a river is flowing
Somewhere between the earth and the sky, the winds of change are blowing
Somewhere between the two of us a space is growing
Somewhere between suspicion and trust are the things worth knowing.
Somewhere along the road you might want to hitch a ride
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to swallow your pride
Somewhere inside you still remind me of a feeling
Somewhere deeper still are wounds that are not healing.
Chorus
Put your nails in my hand.Pain
Fill my eyes up with sandPain
Papercuts on my tonguePain
We're right now where we begunPain
Somehow I only hurt the ones who really mattered
Somehow she played her role although her soul was battered
Someday soon I know my ashes will be scattered
Someday soon I know my former becomes latter

Just give me a little trust
And answer me

I don't know who my friend are, who my friends will be

You're my driver, I'm your passenger
The night is looking friendlier than any day
We're racing into it and I will go that way
The future is bright
We'll drive by night

We're busy making our own way
We'll sleep in the shade
And watch what we've made

Please accept my apologies, I wonder what would have been.
Would you have been a little angel or an angel of sin?
Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys.
Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes.
I paid for the murder before they determined the sex,
Choosing our life over your life meant your death.
And you never got a chance to even open your eyes,
Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life.
Would you have been a little genius? In love with math?
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad?
Would you have been a little rapper like your poppa The Piper?
Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters?
I wonder about your skin tone and shape of your nose,
And the way you would've laughed and talked fast or slow.
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen.
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would've been.

What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
I made a mistake
I got a million excuses, as to why you died.
And other people got their own reasons for homicide.
Who's to say it would've worked and who's to say it wouldn't have
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad.
The fear of being my father has never disappeared,
I ponder it frequently while I'm sippin' on my beer.
My vision of a family was artificial and fake
So when it came time to create, I made a mistake.
But now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you.
Maybe you really forgave us knowing we were confused.
Maybe, every time that he smiles it's you proudly knowing
That your father's doing the right thing now.
I'll never tell a woman what to do with her body,
But if she don't love children, then we can't party.
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen.
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would've been.
Happy Birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
I made a mistake
And from the Heavens to the womb to the Heavens again.

In a place without time and space. Happy birthday.

We set off upon a journey, each together, each alone
In the days that followed oh our lives did overlap
I learned the contours of your body like the roads upon a map
You sweetened every evening, I savoured every day
Just when I was certain it would always be this way
You slipped beyond the reach of my outstretched fingertips
With all the kisses we'd placed upon your lips

Oh near. So near

Sent my spies to fathom out the secrets in your head

Spinning through the summer night
In the company of strangers
And your eyes were wild and bright
Though I grew reclusive and my days became withdrawn
I held the banner of our love, now tattered and forlorn
And swore that it would one day fly above us once again
To do this, I had my reasons then

Close. You're close
Once again, come shine a light
Oh near. So near

Perhaps there are some passions that are tempered by the years
You reach accommodation, the intensity recedes

Eating the fat of the land while it's us that pay the price

Flesh hungry vultures picking our remains
Shitting on the world they've shat on many times before
Fucked it good and proper in the name of law

Just fuck off and have your fun
Hoist your Jolly Roger and wave your plastic gun
With your painted faces and your elegant style
How about trying to think for a while?
As your decorate your lifestyle with cheap consumer bliss
Forget about loving, it's your arse you're going to kiss
As long as they've got you under their thumb
With T.V. lobotomy and media fun

All sandals and out of tune guitars
And she talks in terrified tones of skeleton bones
Screaming through a mangled microphone

Around the time I first went on my own
When the roads were as many as the places I had dreamed of
And my friends and I were one
Now the distance is done and the search has begun
I've come to see where my beginnings have gone
Oh the walls and the windows were still standing
And the music could be heard at the door
Where the people who kindly endured my odd questions
Asked if I came very far
And when my silence replied they took me inside
Where their children sat playing on the floor
Well we spoke of the changes that would find us farther on
And it left me so warm and so high
But as I stepped back outside to the grey morning sun
I heard that highway whisper and sigh
Are you ready to fly?
And I looked into the faces all passing by
It's an ocean that will never be filled
And the house that grows older and finally crumbles
That even love cannot rebuild
It's a hotel at best, you're here as a guest
You oughta make yourself at home while you're waiting for the rest
Well I looked into dream of the millions
That one day the search will be through
Now here I stand at the edge of my embattled illusions
Looking into you
The great song traveler passed through here
And he opened my eyes to the view
And I was among those who called him a prophet
And I asked him what was true
Until the distance had shown how the road remains alone
Now I'm looking in my life for a truth that is my own
Well I looked into the sky for my anthem
And the words and the music came through

So you reached out, entirely fearless
And yet you knew of reservation and how it serves
And I salute you for your courage
And I applaud your perseverance
And I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces

So you were in but not entirely
You were up for this but not totally
You knew how arms length-ing can maintain doubt
And so you fell and you're intact
So you dove in and you're still breathing
So you jumped and you're still flying if not shocked
And I support you in your trusting
And I commend you for your wisdom
And I'm amazed by your surrender in the face of threatening forces

You found creative ways to distance
You hid away from much through humor
Your choice of armor was your intellect
And so you felt and you're still here
And so you died and you're still standing
And so you softened and you're still safely in command

Faces from the endless plains of Russia

Reaching their hands for a grip
On the edge just to slip back again

If you just use your head
You can make your fortune here
One lucky break and that's all it would take

Another day, another ship pulls into harbor
And the crowd spills down the gangway
Clutching their suitcases tight
Blinking in the sunlight at the door of the new world
They hold the handrail
With all the post thrown behind
Caught in between now and forever
Wondering just what lies ahead
Each one is waiting and hoping
The door will be open to them

On the crazy down low take my mom's wedding ring

So I jetted like the concord but I made a crash landing
Got back on the glass cause life is demanding
First thing to do now is to get a little pistol
I like to smoke blow but I don't like eating gristle

Just run ya doe or your mom will be a mourner

Care about his worthless bro -- the answer no

Donating about twenty dollars a week
80 dollars a month for that I get a blunt

What am I saying, I can't believe I'm a junkie
I can't believe it yo frank nitty punch me
Suicide is too good, I need something harder
Maybe go cold turkey, that'll hurt me

For greater causes that brought us down to this
The ground is shaking from all the people below
One thing I've learned from this is,
What you reap is what you sow
In elderly forms and surroundings
In the flesh of spirits incarnated
They are here for the hate forgotten
A rearview mirror to all lost souls
A slow burn shattered the field
Pain through body fire drained vein
Walk down to the watchtower
And with the right kind of eyes
See waves roll in and over
Never could you see the watermark
Man marches through the rust and dust
The burning fields will soon be ashes
Bodies woven in smoke and skin
And clouds descend to the sea

At the time just a little white lie.
It was one of the first, but it hurt me the most,
And the truth stung like tears in my eye;
That even the good guys must die.

For all that we see is not what it seems; am I blind?
And you sit there and talk revolution,
But can you tell me just who's in command?
When you tell me the forces we are fighting
Then I'll gladly join and make plans.
But for now, only, our t-shirts cry freedom,
And our voices are gagged by our greed.
Our minds are harnessed by knowledge
By the hill and the will to succeed.
And if that's not what you believe,
Would you let me know I'm not standing alone;
That I'm not just a voice in the crowd.
If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little helping hand, just a little understanding.
Just a little understanding to the questions that I'm asking you.

Where nothing, here, is ever what it seems.
I'm scared to shout in case I draw attention from the powers
That preside over our minds and our lives.
When they find what I want is the deadliest weapon; that is truth;
Day by day it's getting louder,
And day by day it's getting stronger.
But when I can't scream no more, and I need reassurance,
I listen to the crowd.

And traced it down to a canal that ran
Right through the heart of the city,
Like an open vein full of black rotten blood.
A mirror surface, broken only by the bubbles of gas
Escaping from the stagnating mess that lay on the bottom.
Fuelled by the chemicals and effluent of the city,
Which was fed, in turn, by the barges and the ships
That followed that line and created the waves across that
Surface to the dockside, where they unloaded their holds.
The swarms of people clambering over them.

And minding my own business,
And a voice spoke in my ears as if it recognized
That I was questioning the source of the smell.
Have another beer boy, take it with a pinch of snuff.
And my eyes were bedazzled, by the jewels in his silken cuff.
And a voice rolled out from an ashen cloud from behind a long cigar;
Son, you'll never need to smell the black canal.

And, as the afternoon was wasted, I became aware
I was becoming wrapped up in his world.
I became aware of the smell from the bouquet in his buttonhole.
It was taking me away from the canal,
And away from my questions.
I was aware that the perfumes were all around us;
And he sold me the city, well at least he tried to with all his stories.
All the silks out of China,
And all the satins out of Spain.
All the powders for your noses
Will keep the stench at bay.

With this promises and his beer.

And snorted the flower in his buttonhole.

All believers dead and gone

Destroying those who've lost their way

The third Vail
Unleashes blood on the rivers and springs
The fourth angle
Pours his bowl on the sun, scorching people with the fire
The fifth Vail
Unleashes night on the kingdom of the beast

Holds the cup in her hand, filled with filthy adultery

and tell you how to measure love
you'll tell me how to measure dust
you said don't mix the past and future up
it just blurs a line that never was
is it true?
i never thought I'd ever lose you
red and green turn black and blue
you're the only thing that ever glistened
this Christmas I'll be missing you
silent night no mistletoe
I'm kissin' on your Christmas ghost
if the season bring you back to me
i will make that wish on new years ever
cause you're that gift i never earned
but this state is known to have a curse
Nat King Cole i guess he never learned
chestnuts unattended always burn
they burn
is it true?
i never thought I'd ever lose you
when red and green turn black and blue
you're the only thing that ever glistened
this Christmas I'll be missing you
white blankets bright lights
starry eyed skies
won't you come home tonight?
it's true...

One wish granted and others dodged
Lots of anger inside the house
Lonely hands beg to fight
But no one dies, no one cries
Except for you, you aching soul
I know you must have a heart of gold
So come on in, come inside
And make things right, make things right
