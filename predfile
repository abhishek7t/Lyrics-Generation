When you walk that stage	Let's get back to the fundamental things
Climb upon your star	Till they get to the end
Well I guess he don't know it, but I'm the Outlaw Scumfuc	I'm running out of ideas
Your brittle heart	Oh boy
Saw you turning waving ready to spill	What's a boy to do?
Yeah, I was fucked from the start	Wish I had a few more hours in the day
'Cause you don't know	Where you're running to
Well it means nothing	I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
{chorus}	You will find things that you don't want to see
I couldn't stand his lies	And now before he tries it
Too much, it hurts too much	Your crazy heart, my crazy love, repent now
Such a bitch, why do I wanna watch you	You shouldered all the night before
It ain't punk rock and it will never be	The rivers ever growin' the fish is flowin'
Oh and its getting hard to see, its getting hard to see	Have you ever felt this lack of freedom
Shuffle through all the gazes I know better than to meet	Woo!
Rip Taylor Rip Taylor	Your girlfriend we nailed her
Oh, go on	get yourself a woman!
Sharing my dreams with the people around me	The cracks are zig zagging their way over
I won't erase the past, I've got nothing to hide	Kick the sand in Satan's face
If you come dance with me	I want to take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round
But time moves slow	Tonight
Ever since the very day she left me	It easy to lose all your
Heading for the slaughter	Lapping up the winds
I breed the ones I knew I could	With a breath taker,
Send a shudder	Behind the door of every house,
But time has made some changes, turned me upside down	Bye bye baby
Don't give in until you won - No rules!	So they planed there future as they laid close together
To bring it back in reverse, rewind	The righteous run into
Oh oh prisoner	Keep treating the curse,
When you're heart is breakin' and you want some lovin' from me	Count down from ten
Our sailors	Ripping away at her heart
high like it's legal...i'm high...	By day three I wish you'd come right back to me.
And leave you behind	She do the hardest things for free
The bluebird was high on the wing	As our days are crawling by so slowly
oh i follow through	Sure as the wind blows
There in the night that has heard a thousand voices	Surprise, surprise, we saw through the lies
He gave them toffees and played their games	to unlock the door and let you in
Yeah	Midnight believer
You are my king, You are my God	Lift your voices
Stripped me	I get a feeling way down in my soul , ah
Rise to claim Saturn, ring and sky	you're all I need, my love, my valentine
Here, all for what is yet	Think I wanna make that move, now
In a mean, endless grave ?	In the coming years from now
Like the swallows of San Juan	I'm gonna get back, get back some day
from all that we see	I ain't trippin' homie / talk is cheap
with your friends	and you don't seem to tire
My Feet Are Dragging Never Felt Like This	In times like these
Over and over so sweet	Going home
My soul sings a different song	The bags underneath my eyes
And a little wee drummer intending to camp	For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'
Don't contribute, try to change it.	Who need to be close, close to the light
Does anybody really care (care about time)	And I'll let the rain roll off my back.
You've been blinded, living lie a one way cold existence all the while	You look down but far from out
But we just can't be happy,	Meeting secretly,
Until you are free	So keep moving onward
And cross your arms	Jaguar in fever
This is how I do	He used to do some rapping but he wasn't really trying
Love me for me	I'll call your bluff, I've had enough
And I'ma be around until you see the light of day	He was named after the hurricane
There's no room in a political dream	The people cleared their throats and stared right back at him
13,14 Its a teenage warning	ThatÃ¢??s etched in her skin
Valentina, this is not like you	I hear church bells ringing in my head
This time I knew that it wasn't right	Like you I fell into the problem
Put the greatest record on	Sha la la la, I'm in love with a Jersey girl
Fall, sometimes I fall so fast	I feel the breath of a storm.
Shining	I go my way
And our eyes were alive	If you don't hear me, then why should I hear you?
The girl with the saccharine smile	All that you ask for comes from dreams
In her room alone at night	If I had seen that you'd accept,
You had a warm bed you never saw.	No, not while I'm around.
You can stop and taste the honey	A cab for two
And say "Hey man, I knew him when he was younger"	But she never loved me at all
It's the only weapon I kept from the war	And I can soothe every ailment you endure
With one word, he might save your soul	It's just moving on
The air is clear, clearer that the taste of tears,	All of my life was filled with desire
tears & mascara	I open my lungs to breathe in forgiveness and love
under the sky to live is to die	Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.
What you've to become, Hollow and numb	The sickness, it eats away,
You pinched my fingers	And you were such a mess and I thought it was sweet,
Must I paint you a picture	Relationships deteriorate
Darling, don't you use me	With mumbled strange goodbyes
Yes I can see nobody's face	Freeway - red line
It's easy, it's easy	And who's gonna save me now
They threaten us with loss of our freedom and soul	And they say that this feeling I'm feelin'
I must no longer neglect my inner child	But I can't get enough
And if I live too long, I might not treat you right	Close the door, now you're shining way too bright
I live my life	Why do you do me down, Mister?
Eventually I got my degree	Living in our home
Your eyes are black as midnight	Denied another day
Out of the looking-glass	I'll buy you a diamond ring, if you just give me some of your love.
The beggar, thief and courtesan I've been	Was that yesterday?
You're on your feet six days a week	Push come to shove
It's always too soon	So where are you going when you know where you belong?
No one sees, but I see you	I got to find my baby,
Corina can you dance with me	Corina can you dance with me
(Ever since you went away)	You want to ride White Lightnin'
And I know there is comfort	I wanna know
I'm not the only man	To pour out your distress on
Well, isn't that a shame?	Of this desert oasis
These complications will bring us to our knees	As his truck tyres lurched down the
