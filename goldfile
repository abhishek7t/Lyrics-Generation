When you walk that stage	Shimmy shake like Betty Page
Climb upon your star	If you believe you'll find
Well I guess he don't know it, but I'm the Outlaw Scumfuc	Someone aughta' warn him before I knock him straight to Hell
Your brittle heart	Billy stands
Saw you turning waving ready to spill	Know where they belong
Yeah, I was fucked from the start	I've got two black eyes and a blacker heart
'Cause you don't know	Where you're running to
Well it means nothing	If it's too short to be happy
{chorus}	But others wouldn't see things you could only see
I couldn't stand his lies	And now before he tries it
Too much, it hurts too much	This hurts too much
Such a bitch, why do I wanna watch you	Disconnect and self destruct one woman at a time
It ain't punk rock and it will never be	we need to fight, and unite
Oh and its getting hard to see, its getting hard to see	I aint got a new car, no mansion on a hill
Shuffle through all the gazes I know better than to meet	Finally to find a home I finally have to leave
Rip Taylor Rip Taylor	Your girlfriend we nailed her
Oh, go on	Here we go
Sharing my dreams with the people around me	Now they surround me
I won't erase the past, I've got nothing to hide	I hope these times will last because I'm enjoying the ride
If you come dance with me	I think you will like my moves
But time moves slow	Tonight
Ever since the very day she left me	It easy to lose all your
Heading for the slaughter	I've been away from home too long
I breed the ones I knew I could	I breed the ones who always
Send a shudder	Down the gutter
But time has made some changes, turned me upside down	So, you can beg me to forgive you, but this time, baby, you can turn right around
Don't give in until you won - No rules!	Never compromise your feelings - No Rules!
To bring it back in reverse, rewind	Yes, I believe in the sands of time
Oh oh prisoner	My pretty, oh oh prisoner
When you're heart is breakin' and you want some lovin' from me	There won't be anymore, it won't be like before
Our sailors	I'm sick of dour faces
high like it's legal...i'm high...	high like it's legal...i'm high...
And leave you behind	I know the name of his game
The bluebird was high on the wing	Whatever happened to Saturday night
oh i follow through	Oh and here i stand
There in the night that has heard a thousand voices	Whispered a thousand names
He gave them toffees and played their games	He brought them presents with every coins he made
Yeah	I can't slow down
You are my king, You are my God	Lift your voices
Stripped me	Stripped me
Rise to claim Saturn, ring and sky	By those who see with their eyes closed
Here, all for what is yet	All for what is yet"
In a mean, endless grave ?	Tell me
Like the swallows of San Juan	I'm gonna get back, get back some day
from all that we see	why should we worry
with your friends	and you don't seem to tire
My Feet Are Dragging Never Felt Like This	Wondering Where You Are
Over and over so sweet	Tell you he'll never leave
My soul sings a different song	In America
And a little wee drummer intending to camp	For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'
Don't contribute, try to change it.	Be forgiving, to all living.
Does anybody really care (care about time)	If so I can't imagine why (no, no)
You've been blinded, living lie a one way cold existence all the while	Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes you long lost child
But we just can't be happy,	Meeting secretly,
Until you are free	And facing the truth
And cross your arms	And if you're lucky
This is how I do	When I think about you
Love me for me	Stick around,
And I'ma be around until you see the light of day	I can see your pain
There's no room in a political dream	There's no room in a law
13,14 Its a teenage warning	15,16 But nobody's listening
Valentina, this is not like you	I hear church bells ringing in my head
This time I knew that it wasn't right	Three people torn to pieces from a child's past
Put the greatest record on	I kick the dog, I kick the cat
Fall, sometimes I fall so fast	When I hit that bottom crash
Shining	Shining
And our eyes were alive	Deep inside we knew our love was true
The girl with the saccharine smile	I see through her smile
In her room alone at night	She just moved in a month ago
You had a warm bed you never saw.	Are we ok? Will you sleep it off?
You can stop and taste the honey	It's a sweet life, baby, it's all about the sugar
And say "Hey man, I knew him when he was younger"	But she never loved me at all
It's the only weapon I kept from the war	And I can soothe every ailment you endure
With one word, he might save your soul	Snap like a whip, he won't quit
The air is clear, clearer that the taste of tears,	Clearer than me smell of fear and I`m fearful for a long cold year with you,
tears & mascara	hopeless & haunting the
under the sky to live is to die	radiation black the night and I
What you've to become, Hollow and numb	The sickness, it eats away,
You pinched my fingers	In a door
Must I paint you a picture	About the way that I feel?
Darling, don't you use me	I don't want to land in jail
Yes I can see nobody's face	And I just gonna break down an' cry
It's easy, it's easy	Until I think about him
They threaten us with loss of our freedom and soul	They employ all of these tactics to keep their control
I must no longer neglect my inner child	For he is very close
And if I live too long, I might not treat you right	Close the door, now you're shining way too bright
I live my life	Don't wanna waste no time
Eventually I got my degree	But the real thing I did learn
Your eyes are black as midnight	Death comes trippin' and runnin'
Out of the looking-glass	And sees her standing by her side
The beggar, thief and courtesan I've been	Oh, that I've been
You're on your feet six days a week	We're working nights just tryin' to make ends meet
It's always too soon	It's always too soon to be cold for comfort
No one sees, but I see you	...wanted
Corina can you dance with me	Corina can you dance with me
(Ever since you went away)	That's when Paula sparks
And I know there is comfort	Where we overlap
I'm not the only man	To pour out your distress on
Well, isn't that a shame?	Where does he go? No one knows
These complications will bring us to our knees	What makes us stronger? The fighting will bring us into, us into
